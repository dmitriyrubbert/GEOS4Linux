Install and configure java on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.java
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared, I use this playbook to ensure everything is in place to let the role work.
```yaml
---
- name: Default
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
```


Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml

# Valid for "java_vendor == oracle" and "java_format" == "rpm"
java_rpm_source: local

# Choose if you can JCE installed. Only applicable for (both):
# - java_vendor == "oracle"

java_jce: yes

# In case of "java_vendor == oracle" and "java_format == targz", a directory

java_install_directory: /opt
```

```yaml

Included version(s)
-------------------

This role [refers to a version](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-java/blob/master/vars/main.yml) released by Oracle. Check the released version(s) here:
- [java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/downloads/index.html).

This version reference means a role may get outdated. Monthly tests occur to see if [bit-rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) occured. If you however find a problem, please create an issue, I'll get on it as soon as possible.
Testing
-------

[Unit tests](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-java) are done on every commit, pull request, release and periodically.

If you find issues, please register them in [GitHub](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-java/issues)

Testing is done using [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule):

[Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tests multiple ansible versions.
[Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule) tests multiple distributions.

To test using the defaults (any installed ansible version, namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`):

```
molecule test

# Or select a specific image:
image=ubuntu molecule test
# Or select a specific image and a specific tag:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```

Or you can test multiple versions of Ansible, and select images:
Tox allows multiple versions of Ansible to be tested. To run the default (namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`) tests:

```
tox

# To run CentOS (namespace: `robertdebock`, tag: `latest`)
image="centos" tox
# Or customize more:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```
